Top three books that have made me a better software programmer:

In no particular order, I would like to mention "Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming" by
Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi. This book has provided me a good insight in different programming techniques and design
principles. It was enjoyable to experience how different problems can be solved in a non-intuitive way and also learn
about the stepping stones of programming languages.

The second book I would like to mention is "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
This book made me interested in algortihms in general as well as it taught me how to approach NP-complete problems.
Another part I liked was the focus on optimizing codes in terms of run time and how that could be achieved by using
different data structures.

Finally, because of my interest in algorithms, the book "Artificial Intelligence" by Russel and Norvig is very
interesting as the main theme is about the idea of an intelligent agent. Different problem-solving search algorithms are
presented in a good way that gave me a better understanding of how knowledge and intelligence can be programmed.
